Hello! We are the researchers of Group 1 from Grade 12 - ICT B1. Welcome to our student academic tracker system “EduFlow”. The purpose of the researchers’ study is to determine whether or not academic trackers are effective in a student’s academic performance and encourage productivity.

EduFlow is a student academic tracker that helps a student track down tasks like activities and projects, upcoming events, and create/upload notes. With these features combined, it meets three aspects: motivation, time management, and organization.

We hope you enjoy using all the features our system has to offer. If you have finished testing them out, you can visit our “Feedback” page to answer a quick survey about your experience. Thank you!
